# Nvim Lua Config

My init.lua and config: [Starting from scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch)

* Clone this into `~/.config/nvim/`
* Make soft link from `ftplugin/` to `~/.local/share/nvim/site/ftplugin/`

Unfortunately, the install and config folders seem to vary from platform to platform. YMMV.

Also consider soft links to appropriate folders in `~/.vim/` to have the same setup in vim, gvim, nvim, nvim-qt, etc etc.
